## A. Problem Statement:
Many people struggle to maintain a regular fitness routine and achieve their health goals due to a lack of accurate information and real-time feedback about their physical activities and overall health. Often, people do not know how many calories they are burning, how active they are throughout the day, or how their activities impact their overall health.

To address these needs, a health fitness tracker is needed that can monitor various aspects of health and physical activity, such as the number of steps taken, distance traveled, rest time, amount of water consumed, and quality of sleep. This device should also provide personalized feedback and recommendations based on the collected data to help users achieve their fitness goals and maintain a healthier lifestyle.
