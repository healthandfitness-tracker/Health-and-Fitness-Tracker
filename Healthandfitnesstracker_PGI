## A. Problem Statement:
       Many people struggle to maintain a regular fitness routine and achieve their health goals due to a lack of accurate information and real-time feedback about their physical activities
and overall health. Often, people do not know how many calories they are burning, how active they are throughout the day, or how their activities impact their overall health.
To address these needs, a health fitness tracker is needed that can monitor various aspects of health and physical activity, such as the number of steps taken, distance traveled, 
rest time, amount of water consumed, and quality of sleep. This device should also provide personalized feedback and recommendations based on the collected data to help users achieve 
their fitness goals and maintain a healthier lifestyle.


## B. Project Description: 
      The Health and Fitness Tracker project aims to create a website that users to take charge of their health and fitness by tracking and managing essential health metrics. 
The website will allow users to record daily activities, monitor their health progress, set personal goals, and receive insights based on their performance. By offering a data-driven approach to 
health management and we'll promote positive lifestyle changes and help users achieve their fitness goals.

The project will integrate multiple key features to support users in managing and improving their health:

3.Daily Activity Log
     Users can enter activities like walking, running, or cycling with a few taps. For each activity, 
the app will automatically estimate calories burned based on duration, distance, and intensity level. This quick logging system makes tracking fitness easy and helps users understand their daily activity levels.
